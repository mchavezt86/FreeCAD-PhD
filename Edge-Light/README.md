# Edge-Light

* **LSC-holder03-Boards.FCStd** The _Column_ part is fixed to the Maqueen robot using screws and nuts and 4 are required to hold the _MuxSupport_ part over the robot. The _MuxSupport_ part holds the boards for the Arduino Due and the TCA9548A multiplexer.
* **explode.FCStd**: The _PD-holder-cap_ part is fixed to the colour sensor using screws and nuts. In its centre, there is a hole that fits the ball lens. Using the _PD-cap_ part, the ball lens is fixed. The _SlitHorizontal_ part is put over the _PD-cap_, limiting the amount of light not intended for communication to reach the colour sensor. The _SpacerShadow_ and _CS-Ext_ parts are used to fix the _PD-holder-cap_ to the position on top of the robot and to limit the amount of ambient light that is noise.
* **LSC-holder04-Robot.FCStd**: Four _Column_ parts are required to be fixed to the Maqueen using screws and nuts. On the other end, they hold the _FinalCSHolder_ part and the _HolderBase_ part: the latter goes over the first one and has one surface with retro-reflector material. The LSC goes over this _HolderBase_ part and below the _HolderTop_ part. These two parts are fixed using screws and nuts. The final part in the **explode.FCStd** file is fixed to each side of the robot using the _FinalCSHolder_ part, which has holes at each side.
