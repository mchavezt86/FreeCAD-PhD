# Sol-Fi

For this project, it is important to mention that the dichroic filter has a disc shape.

* **SunlightCollector+Dichroic01.FCStd**: The main structure (_FullBase_) can hold up to two LC and dichroic filters for multiplexing. In the single-channel configuration use the one on the left with no dichroic filter. The _FibreFixer_ can be screwed on the output of the sunlight collector and fits into the _FibreHolder_, which in turns fit into the _FullBase_.
