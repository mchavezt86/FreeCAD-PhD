# Sol-Fi

For this project, it is important to mention that the dichroic filter has a disc shape.

* **SunlightCollector+Dichroic01.FCStd**: The main structure (_FullBase_) can hold up to two LC and dichroic filters for multiplexing. In the single-channel configuration use the one on the left with no dichroic filter. The _FibreFixer_ can be screwed on the output of the sunlight collector and fits into the _FibreHolder_, which in turn fits into the _FullBase_.
* **dmd-dichroic.FCStd**: The _DichroicHolder_ part can be fixed to the DMD board and the optical engine using screws. The left pole has a hole for the plastic optical fibre which captures light from the sunlight collector. The _7degBase_ part sets a fixed inclination to the _DichroicHolder_ part. The _Dichroic-Holder02 (Mirror #1)_ can be fixed at the front of the  _DichroicHolder_ part and can hold the dichroic filter in the dual channels configuration.
